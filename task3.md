Task 3: Navigating Through Directories

1. cd 
 # change directory

## I used cd to navigate to different directories. For example, to go to the home directory, I used cd ~. To go to the parent directory, I used cd .. to move up one level in the directory hierarchy.

2. cd /
## change directory to root directory. 


3. cd ~/usergrop3
## The ~ is a shortcut for the home directory. The ~/usergrop3 is the path to the usergrop3 directory. 


4. cd ..  
## Move up one directory level. The cd .. command moves up one directory level.

    ## Purpose/Explanation:

## The ls command lists the contents of a directory.    I used it to see files and subdirectories.

6. ls -l

 ## I also used ls -l which provides a "long list" format, showing detailed information like file permissions, owner, group, size, and last modification date. This helped me understand file attributes at a glance.
