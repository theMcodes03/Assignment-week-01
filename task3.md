# Task 3: Navigating Through Directories

1. cd 
 # change directory

## I used cd to navigate to different directories. For example, to go to the home directory, I used cd ~. To go to the parent directory, I used cd .. to move up one level in the directory hierarchy.

2. cd /
## change directory to root directory. 


3. cd ~/usergrop3
## The ~ is a shortcut for the home directory. The ~/usergrop3 is the path to the usergrop3 directory. 


4. cd ..  
## Move up one directory level. The cd .. command moves up one directory level.
