#Task 1: Basic File and Directory Navigation

## Description

In this task I focused on familiarizing myself with fundamental Linux commands for navigating the file system and listing directory contents. These commands are essential for understanding where you are and what files are available.

## Commands Used

1. Create the File
with command 

touch manisha.txt

![touch](images/touch.png)


2. ls (and ls -l)

    ## Purpose/Explanation:

## The ls command lists the contents of a directory.    I used it to see files and subdirectories.

![ls](images/ls.png)

3. ls -l

 ## I also used ls -l which provides a "long list" format, showing detailed information like file permissions, owner, group, size, and last modification date. This helped me understand file attributes at a glance.

4. cd 
change directory
I used cd to navigate to different directories. For example, to go to the home directory, I used cd ~. To go to the parent directory, I used cd .. to move up one level in the directory hierarchy.
