# Assignment-week-01 -  Updates from Feature Branch

My practice exercises for Linux command-line tasks, fully updated for Git.

## Assignments Overview

Here are the detailed assignments for each task:

* [Task 1: Basic File and Directory Navigation](task1.md)
* [Task 2: File and Directory Manipulation](task2.md)
* [Task 3: User and Group Management](task3.md)
* [Task 5: More Linux Commands](task5.md)


Feel free to explore each task's details. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!

Practicing all these commands gave me confidence in using Linux from the terminal. It felt good to not just memorize but actually understand what each command does. I'm starting to feel more comfortable using Linux in real scenarios now.
